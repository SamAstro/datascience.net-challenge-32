## Synopsis
This is my Jupyter notebook analysing the [datascience.net]
(http://www.datascience.net) [challenge
32](https://www.datascience.net/fr/challenge/32/details) data. It runs with a
Python 3.x kernel.

## Prerequisites
You need:

* Jupyter  
* Python 3.x  
* the challenge data [here](https://www.datascience.net/fr/challenge/32/details)  
* A couple of Python lib :  
    * Numpy  
    * Pandas  
    * Sklear  
    * Seaborn
    * Matplotlib

## Structure

## Running

To run the notebook, you need Jupyter installed with a Python 3.x kernel. See
the environment folder for a conda env import file. Then just run 
```
> jupyter notebook
```
in the correct directory.
